# Vinman Converse

Disclaimer:
I do not have full control over the AI’s responses or behavior. I provided system instructions to guide it in the intended direction; however, unless I pre-train the model I’m working with and conduct extensive red-teaming, the responses generated will be very unreliable. The AI may occasionally produce inaccurate information, hallucinate, or behave in unexpected ways, which I have no control over.
